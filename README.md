# Hello, my name is Alexander Vadeboncoeur 
Welcome! I am a full-stack web developer looking to create and collaberate with other developers. I am currently enrolled in a web development bootcamp, and I intend to enter the field of Computer Science and continue my education as a programmer!

I enjoy working in JavaScript, implementing libraries ranging such as Jquery, Bootstrap, and many more!

### A little bit about me:
  - I am a Texas Native.
  - I am a cyclist. :bike:
  - I am a dog lover. :dog:
  - I enjoy building web apps that operate fluidly and are interactive for the user.
  - I am an extremely tecnichal and detial oriented individual. I seek out the __HOW__ it works and __WHY__ it is used, behind everything from Coding script and it's functionality to mechanical machines.

### I am always looking build my skillset and expand upon my knowledge, find new projects to work on and meet other developers to collaberate with. Please reach out for more info!

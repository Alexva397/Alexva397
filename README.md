# Alexander Vadeboncoeur 
Welcome! I am a full-stack web developer looking to create and collaberate with other developers. I am currently enrolled in a web development bootcamp, and intend to enter the field of Computer Science and continue my education as a programmer!

I enjoy working in JavaScript, implementing libraries ranging such as Jquery, Bootstrap, and many more!

### A little bit about me:
  - I am a Texas Native.
  - I am a cyclist. :bike:
  - I am an extremely tecnichal and detial oriented individual. I seek out the __HOW__ it works and __WHY__ it is used, behind everything from Coding script and it's functionality to mechanical machines.
